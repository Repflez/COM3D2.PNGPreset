The PNG preset will appear in the preset folder. If there is ExtPreset data, it will be included inside the PNG.

To load a preset, put it into `Preset` folder and load normally.

**Alternatively**, you can add presets by dragging and dropping them when you're in edit mode:

## I want to uninstall this! How do I convert PNG presets to normal presets?

Sorry to hear that! In order to convert PNG presets to normal presets, use PNG2Preset tool included in [releases](https://github.com/denikson/COM3D2.PNGPreset/releases).

Simple drag and drop PNG files you want to convert and the tool will do the rest.
